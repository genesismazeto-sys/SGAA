# SGAA Documentation Index

## Authority hierarchy

1. **Canonical repository state** — `git` commit/tree facts are the single source
   of truth. Chat memory and unsaved documentation carry zero authority.
2. **This index** — defines the mandatory reading order, documents the authority
   hierarchy, and records closeout rules.
3. **Project state** (`PROJECT_STATE.md`) — authoritative current-state block at
   the top; historical blocks beneath are preserved but superseded by newer
   blocks or phase closeouts.
4. **Master plan** (`docs/mapeamento/05_avaliacao_refactor.md`) — the incremental
   refactor plan; frozen Phase 0–6 decomposition with completion matrix and
   formal decisions.
5. **Architecture refactor ledger** (`docs/refactor/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_LEDGER.md`)
   — normalized table of every refactor phase, commits, status, and residual risk.
6. **Phase contracts** (`docs/refactor/REF_*.md`) — per-phase scope, decisions,
   and closeout evidence. Standalone contracts exist for: REF-0TF, REF-0TF-A,
   REF-0TF-B, REF-0C-A, REF-0C-B1-P0, REF-0C-B2-A, REF-0C-B2, REF-0C-C-A,
   REF-0C-C-B1. No standalone contract exists for REF-0A, REF-0ENV, REF-0B,
   REF-0T, REF-0C-A-R1, or REF-0C-D; their scope is documented in the ledger
   and PROJECT_STATE historical blocks.
7. **Agent handoff** (`AGENT_HANDOFF.md`) — current operational handoff for the
   next executor; the top block is operationally canonical but is **not** a
   substitute for the repository canon.
8. **Supporting evidence** — tests and artifacts under `tests/` (especially
   `tests/_artifacts/`) and tools under `tools/`.
9. **Legacy / historical** — older blocks, superseded contracts, and historical
   architecture snapshots preserved for audit trail; they do not govern current
   work.

## Mandatory reading order (first time on this branch)

1. `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` — this file.
2. `docs/mapeamento/README.md` — top-level map index.
3. `docs/mapeamento/05_avaliacao_refactor.md` — master plan, Phase 0–6.
4. `docs/refactor/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_LEDGER.md` — phase ledger.
5. `PROJECT_STATE.md` — canonical current state (top block).
6. `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — current operational handoff.
7. All `docs/refactor/REF_*.md` / `docs/refactor/PHASE_0_*.md` files in dependency order: REF-0TF →
   REF-0TF-A → REF-0TF-B → REF-0C-A → REF-0C-B1-P0 → REF-0C-B1 →
   REF-0C-B2-A → REF-0C-B2 → REF-0C-C-A → REF-0C-C-B1 → REF-0C-D-R1 →
   PHASE_0_SMOKE_FLOW_CONTRACT_AND_EVIDENCE.

## Canonical current state (2026-07-23)

- Branch: `refactor/architecture-safety-net`
- Starting HEAD: `c978ed7471e60f78151608cccafe95f21527553b`
- **PHASE-0-R9A pytest runtime isolation:** CLOSED / ACCEPTED (externally accepted)
- **PHASE-0-R9 smoke-flow contract and evidence:** IMPLEMENTED / LOCALLY VALIDATED / PENDING EXTERNAL ACCEPTANCE
- R9 evidence: `tests/test_phase_0_smoke_flows.py` (new, 5 tests); contract: `docs/refactor/PHASE_0_SMOKE_FLOW_CONTRACT_AND_EVIDENCE.md`
- R9 accepted full hermetic test suite: **654 passed, 17 deselected in 298.82s (0:04:58)**, exit 0; smoke 5/5
- R9 invariant: canonical `database.db`, uploads, documents, backups, logs, `.pytest_cache`, and temp-root sets unchanged; R9-R2 aggregate invariant hash `e3d10dc0e8d782ab73acedd6737f285e37b4e21691218049ad8dc654f1ff3331` (includes five frozen dirty files, canonical database/root manifests, three preexisting temp-root manifests/set, Git status, and empty staging; not the final seven-path Git manifest)
- Production: shadow-only (no hard enforcement)
- **REF-0C-D-R1: CLOSED / ACCEPTED**
- **REF-0C-D: SATISFIED**
- Macro Fase 0: **LOCALLY SATISFIED / AWAITING EXTERNAL SUPERVISOR ACCEPTANCE** — the final bounded remainder (smoke-flow contract/evidence) is now defined and proven
- Fase 1 and production hard enforcement: **unauthorized**
- Production shadow-only: **in force**
- D73H historical lane: **unchanged**
- R20: **unchanged**
- Next action: **external supervisor review only**

## Master plan (Phase 0–6)

Defined in `docs/mapeamento/05_avaliacao_refactor.md`:

- **Macro Fase 0 — Safety net (rede de segurança)**: route inventory, RBAC
  coverage, hermetic suite, smoke flows, actor matrix, fail-closed design.
  **Locally satisfied — smoke-flow contract/evidence defined and proven. Awaiting external acceptance.**
- **Fase 1 — Safe cleanup**: dead code, lixo, headers.
- **Fase 2 — Shared helpers**: extract from `main.py`, break cycle.
- **Fase 3 — Data access consolidation**: unify `init_db`, migrate `ensure_*`.
- **Fase 4 — Blueprint extraction**: one admin blueprint per domain.
- **Fase 5 — Backup/sync offloading**: background jobs.
- **Fase 6 — `main.py` as entrypoint only**: ~50–150 lines.

Fase 1 is **not authorized**. No subsequent phase is authorized.

## Ledger

See `docs/refactor/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_LEDGER.md` for the complete normalized
table of every phase.

Phases without standalone contracts: REF-0A, REF-0ENV, REF-0B, REF-0T,
REF-0C-A-R1. See the ledger and `PROJECT_STATE.md` historical blocks.

## Phase contracts

Each existing `REF_*` document in `docs/refactor/` is a phase contract for that
phase. A standalone contract now exists for REF-0C-D-R1:
`docs/refactor/REF_0C_D_R1_ROUTE_COMPLETE_ACTOR_IMMUTABILITY.md`.
The original REF-0C-D scope was documented in
`docs/refactor/REF_0C_A_RBAC_POLICY_MATRIX_DIAGNOSIS.md` section 20.

## Architecture mapping snapshots (`docs/mapeamento/`)

`docs/mapeamento/README.md` indexes all seven files. The following files are
historical snapshots generated from the state of `main` (2026-06-21) and
predate all REF-0 refactoring phases. They have **not** been revalidated after
the accepted REF-0 changes and may not reflect the current branch state:

- `docs/mapeamento/01_rotas.md` — historical route map (pre-REF-0)
- `docs/mapeamento/02_autenticacao_e_seguranca.md` — historical auth/security
  snapshot (pre-REF-0C-B1, pre-REF-0C-C-B1)

## Legacy / historical

- Older blocks in `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` below the current
  authoritative block are historical phase records. They are preserved for audit
  trail but do not govern current work.
- Superseded phase decisions are recorded in their respective closeout documents
  and the ledger. No content is deleted or compacted.

## Superseded docs

No documentation is explicitly superseded; phase contracts are additive.
The ledger records each phase's closeout. When a later phase amends a prior
finding, the later phase document and the ledger supersede the earlier claim.

## Closeout rules

1. Every phase contract must document its starting HEAD, ending decision, and
   changed files.
2. No phase may claim a SATISFIED status for a requirement that lacks
   repository evidence.
3. Closeout decisions are recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md` and the ledger.
4. Only the supervisor or a documented decision may close or accept a phase.
5. Production hard enforcement, Fase 1–6 work, and route changes are not
   authorized unless a phase contract explicitly permits them.

## GitHub branch/HEAD verification

Before any phase execution:
- Verify branch is `refactor/architecture-safety-net`.
- Verify HEAD matches the expected starting commit.
- Verify worktree and index are clean.
- Verify divergence from `origin/refactor/architecture-safety-net` is `0 0`.
- Re-prove these invariants before any edit.

## Explicit rule

**Chat memory, agent handoff notes, and unsaved documentation are not
substitutes for repository canon.** Every authoritative fact must exist in a
committed file. This index, the ledger, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, and `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
are the canonical entry points.
